# PromptAnalyze_DS210
A project for analyzing my prompt history from two AI agents.

MOTIVATION

While trying to find a dataset for the project I thought of some basic data such as calories I consume daily, steps I take daily but I was not satisfied with them because data I had was not going back to the past too much(only a few weeks) then I found this "briliant" idea to analyse my promt history from AI agents. Almost since ChatGPT has come out I have been using it then I started also using Claude a few months ago. So I had the perfect data set, a data set that had almost 2 years data and which is increasing daily as I study and ask questions. Another important thing is that my data is very informative about me so analyzing the data will be a journey to get to know myself better.(nosce te ipsum)

DATA SOURCE

I am using my chat history from ChatGPT and Claude AI agents. Data is in the .json format.

PROJECT IDEA AND PLAN
My idea is that I can find many different and interesting information in this data and this interesting data is not only about me it can also give us information about spesific deadlines or events that took place. Also I would like to dive a a little deeper into the journey of getting to know myself. I would like to analyse how does AI see me and profile me from the questions I asked. Also I will be trying to analyse how my wording changes from time to time while talking with AI, do I say bad words to AI, why do I say it, when do I say it. So these are some of the key ideas I would like to work on but I am sure in the process some other ideas might come to my mind and I might add some new items or remove some of the topics that I mentioned.

Here is an interesting finding I got while analysing the data roughly:

There are some spesific outliers as you can see: one is April 24th Wednesday it is the day I interacted with AI agents 300+ promts so when I checked why was it that high I found out that we had CS201 homework that night at 10pm, it is so sad that I waste time by chatting AI agents rather than doing my homework. Also there is 17th and 18th of March I interected with AI 250+ times in two consecutive days so when I checked what could have happened in those days, I found out that my girlfriend had a Python homework that had a deadline on 18th of March again it is such a pity for me to chat with AI all day rather than helping my girlfriend with her homework.
