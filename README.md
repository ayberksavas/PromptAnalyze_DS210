## Motivation

While trying to find a dataset for the project, I initially considered basic data such as the calories I consume daily or the steps I take daily. However, I wasn't satisfied with this because the data only went back a few weeks. Then, I had this brilliant idea: to analyze my prompt history with AI agents. Since ChatGPT was released, I’ve been using it extensively, and I started using Claude a few months ago. This meant I had the perfect dataset—almost two years' worth of data that continues to grow daily as I study and ask questions. Moreover, this dataset is very informative about me, so analyzing it will be a journey of self-discovery. (Nosce te ipsum).

## Data Source

I am using my chat history from ChatGPT and Claude AI agents. The data is in JSON format.

## Project Idea and Plan

My idea is that I can uncover various interesting insights from this data. These insights are not only about me but can also reveal specific deadlines or events that took place. Additionally, I aim to explore the journey of getting to know myself better. I plan to analyze how AI perceives me and how it might profile me based on the questions I’ve asked.

I also want to investigate how my wording has changed over time when interacting with AI. For example, do I use bad language with AI? If so, why and when? These are some of the key questions I’d like to explore. However, I anticipate that new ideas might emerge during the analysis, leading me to add or remove topics as needed.

Here’s an interesting finding I discovered during a rough analysis of the data:

There are some specific outliers, as you can see. One of them is April 24th, a Wednesday, when I interacted with AI agents over 300 times. Upon investigation, I realized this spike occurred because we had a CS201 homework deadline that night at 10 PM. It’s so sad that I wasted time chatting with AI agents instead of working on my homework.

Another instance is March 17th and 18th, when I interacted with AI over 250 times across two consecutive days. When I looked into what happened on those days, I found out that my girlfriend had a Python homework deadline on March 18th. Again, it’s such a pity that I spent my time chatting with AI all day instead of helping my girlfriend with her homework.
